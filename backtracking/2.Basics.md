## What is not backtracking?

## Difference betweeen BT, DP and Recursion

DP, BT and Divide and Conquer are part of Recursion itself.

We have choices everytime.

In DP, we have optimal choice to make. [e.g. remember the knapsack problem]

In Recursion, we usually have answer in the last leaf node. [normal recursion behavior]

In DP, we get the answer usually in the root node.

DP Solution -> Recursion + memory (Something optimal)

Backtracting -> Recursion + Control
Usually backtracking is give us all the combinations.

Recursion -> Usually we find the solution in the leaf node.

Backtracking -> Usually, we find the solutions in the paths.
There might be multiple of these paths as a solution.

## Pass by value and Pass by reference
Pass by value -> Pass a copy of a variable to the function. This variable is now different that the value passed. This variable will be stored differently, and can be updated. The update won't be reflected on the original value.

Pass by reference -> Pass the pointer of the variable to the function. Any change to this variable inside the function will be reflected in the original value of the variable.

## Backtracking -> Controlled recursion + pass by reference
