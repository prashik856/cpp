Problem Statement:
Find the largest number in K swaps

Flow:
1) Problem statement input and outputs
2) Identification -> is it Greedy or Backtracking
3) All Choices
Recognise the For loop, base condition, and controlled recursion. 
4) Base Condition
5) Similarity and disimilarity with the last question.

1. Problem Statement Input and Outputs
Input: String s: "1234567"
        int k: 4
Create a largest number after k swaps. Our swaps are limited.

2. Identification if greedy or Backtracking:
