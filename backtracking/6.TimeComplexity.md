4. Don't be too attached

## Time Complexity
Time Complexity usually shows, change, or rate or nature of the output.

O(1) - constant time to solve
O(n) - linear time
O(n^2) - n^2 time to solve
O(n!) - n! time to solve

To calculate Time Complexity, we can try to calculate Work Done by the code as a function of input n.

## Time complexity of recursive tree
It is easy to calculate the work done of a recursive tree.

Work Done = Work Done by a single node * Total number of nodes

How to get total number of nodes?
Total number of nodes depends on the height of the tree and the branching factor of the tree.

For branching factor 2, we usually have
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^n, which is usually a geometric progression.
S(n) = 2^(n+1) - 1.
So, we have O(2^n) time complexity.

Number of nodes = 2^n

Work done on a node = W(n) * 2^n.
For branching factor of 2.

## TC for Permutations of string
Every level will have n * (n-1) number of nodes.

O(factorial)
