# Generalization

## Flow
1. Recap
- Backtracking -> Recursion -> Parent
- Number of choices are large
- Controlled recursion
- Pass by reference

2. Generalization

## Backtracking traits
In recursion, we usually have a base condition. So in BT too, we will be having a base condition.

```
void solve(input) {
    // base condition
    if(baseCondition()) {
        // got our result?
        return or break this call or save this;
    }

    // go through all choices
    for(choice: numberOfChoices) {
        // controlled recursion. get a valid choice.
        if(validate(choice)) {
            // change in our choice as it is valid. 
            // This is true for any recursion call as every recursion call needs to have smaller input.
            changeChoices();

            // do a recursion call.
            solve(choice);

            // backtrack
            changeChoicesBack();
        }
    }

}
```
