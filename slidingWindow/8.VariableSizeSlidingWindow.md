# Variable Size Sliding Window

1. Fixed vs Variable
2. Variable - General Format

Recap:
For Fixed type
```
while(j < size) {
    calculations

    if(winSize <k) j++

    else if(winSize == k) {
        ans  = calculations
        calculations remove i
        window size update and slide
    }
}
```

For Variable size window, it is not possible to keep the window size constant.
For the previous question, the window size was dependent on the provided sum.
Since we cannot maintain our window size, we will have to write the conditinon when calculations/condition > k as well.

The General format for Variable Size
```
while(j < size) {
    calculations
    if(calculations < k) j++
    else if(calculations == k) {
        ans = calculations;
        j++
    } 
    else if(condition > k) {
        while(condition > k) {
            remove calculations for i;
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```
