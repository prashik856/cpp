# Base Condition - Hypothesis - Induction

The basics of recursion

## Problem - print from 1 to N

Flow:
1. Methods to think for a recursive problem
2. Why making input saller is popular/important.
3. Print 1 to N.

We should focus on decision making rather than making input smaller.

Approaches to solve a recursion problem:
1. Recursive Tree - Input/Output method (decision)
2. Base Condition - Induction - Hypotheisi (making input smaller)
3. Choice Diagram (Dynamic Problem)


For any recursive problem, we define a hypothesis.
E.g. if we say solve(n) will print numbers from 1 to n, it will print numbers from 1 to n.

Base Condition:
1. Smallest Valid Input

Hypothesis:
7 comes from input.
print(7) = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

print(n-1) # On 6
1,2,3,4,5,6

So, if print(n) prints from 1 to n, print(n-1) should print from 1 to n-1.

Induction:
print(n) -> gives us from 1 to n.
print(n-1) -> gives us numbers from 1 to n-1.

How will print function looks like:
print(n) {
    print(n-1);
    cout << n << " ";
}

Base Condition:
What is the smallest valid input?
1 is the smallest input.
if(n==1) {
    cout << 1 << endl;
}

```cpp
void print(int n) {
    // base condition
    if(n==0) {
        return;
    }

    // hypothesis
    print(n-1);

    // induction
    cout << n;
}
```

IBH Method (Induction, Base Condition, and Hypothesis) - Very useful in trees, linked lists.


## Beauty of Hypothesis and Induction
```cpp
void print(int n) {
    if(n==1) {
        cout << n << " ";
        return;
    }

    cout << n << " ";

    print(n-1);
}
```
By just changing the induction and hypothesis step, we can directly change the output of the recursive function.
