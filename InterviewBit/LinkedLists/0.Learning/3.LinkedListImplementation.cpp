/*
Linked List Implementation

Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
    1. Data
    2. Pointer to the next node

In C/C++, we can represent a node of Linked List using structures or classes.
In Java and Python, Linked List can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. 
The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type. 

// A linked list node
struct ListNode
{
  int val;
  struct ListNode *next;
};
