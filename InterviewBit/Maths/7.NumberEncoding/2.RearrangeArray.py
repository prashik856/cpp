'''
Rearrange a given array so that Arr[i] becomes Arr[Arr[i]] with O(1) extra space.

Example:

Input : [1, 0]
Return : [0, 1]
Lets say N = size of the array. Then, following holds true :

All elements in the array are in the range [0, N-1]
N * N does not overflow for a signed integer

Solution Approach:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-given-array-place/
Approach: The array elements of the given array lies from 0 to n-1. 
Now an array element is needed that can store two different values at the same time. 
To achieve this increment every element at ith index is incremented by (arr[arr[i]] % n)*n.
After the increment operation of first step, every element holds both old values and new values. 
Old value can be obtained by arr[i]%n and a new value can be obtained by arr[i]/n.

How this can be achieved? 
Letâ€™s assume an element is a and another element is b, 
both the elements are less than n. 
So if an element a is incremented by b*n. 
So the element becomes a + b*n so when a + b*n is divided by n then the value is b and a + b*n % n is a.
