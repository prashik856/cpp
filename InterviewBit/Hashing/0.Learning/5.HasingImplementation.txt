 C++ has unordered_map which is implemented via hashing. We will discuss treemaps in C++ as well later, which in practice seem to behave faster in C++.

Declaration
    unordered_map<int, int> A; // declares an empty map. O(1)

Adding an key, value pair :
    A.insert({key, value}); // O(1) time on average

Find the value for key = K:
    if (A.find(K) == A.end()) return null; //  means that K does not exist in A. 
    else return A[K];    // O(1) average case. Rare worst case O(n). 

Size ( number of elements ) of the vector :
    A.size()  // O(1)

Erase from the map :
    if (A.find(K) != A.end()) A.erase(A.find(K));
     OR A.erase(K);
