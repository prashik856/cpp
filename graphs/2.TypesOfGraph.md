# Types of Graph

1. Directed Graphs (edges has directions and unweighted)
2. Undirected Graphs (no direction and unweighted) 
3. Weighted Graphs (each edge has weight, this graph can be directed or undirected.)
4. Unweighted Graphs (edge does not has weight. Can be directed or undirected.)

5. Complete Graph
6. Disconnected Graph (Forest)
7. Eular Graph
8. Hamiltonian Graph
9. Cyclic Graph
10. Acyclic Graph

9. Pseudo Graph
10. Null Graph (No nodes?)

## Complete Graph
Every node is connected to every other node in the graph.

## Disconnected Graph
Let's say there are N nodes
And 1...N-2 nodes are connected
Nodes N-1 and N are connected.

The connected nodes are called components.

Now, this is called disconnected graphs.
This can also be called a forest.

## Cyclic Graph
A graph which contains a cycle is called a cyclic graph.
Directions are important. We need a closed loop in a graph to be called a cyclic graph.

## Eular Graph
Degree of each node is equal.
Degree is basically the connections of a node.
If a node is connected to 3 other nodes, it's degree will be equal to 3.

## Hamiltonian Graph
We start from a node, and we visit every other node in a graph only once,
and we arrive at the node where we started from, this is called as hamiltonian Graph.

you visit every node only one, except the start node, which we will visit twice.
