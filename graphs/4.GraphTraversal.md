# Graph Traversal

## Breadth First Search
We travel at a equal distance first.
e.g. get all nodes at distance 1, get all nodes at distance 2, etc.
We use queue to implement this.
Equidistant nodes.

## Depth First Search
We travel at a depth and finish it first.
We are focused in a single direction.
Direction based traversal.
We can use recursion or stack here for implementation.
