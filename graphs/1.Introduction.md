# Graphs

1. About graph data structure
2. Graph Series
3. Overview

Graph series is divided into 14 Chapters (Patterns).

## Introduction
We have data structures:
arrays/lists
stacks/queues
linked lists
Trees

## Graph Data structures
Graph has points called as nodes (Vertices).
These nodes are connected with edges.
These nodes can be randomly connected.
This connectivity is called a graph, which will have some nodes and edges.
