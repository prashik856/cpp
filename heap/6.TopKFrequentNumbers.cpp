/**
 * Top K frequent numbers
 * 
 * Given an array of n numbers, our task is to read numbers from array,
 * and keep at most k numbers at the top (according to their decreasing frequency) everytime 
 * the number is read.
 * 
 * We basically need to print top k numbers sorted by their frequency when input stream
 * has included k distinct elements, else need to print all distinct elements sorted by 
 * frequency.
 * 
 * Example:
 * arr[]: {1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4}
 * k: 2
 * Output: 
 *
