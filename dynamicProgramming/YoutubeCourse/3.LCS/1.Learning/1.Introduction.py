Longest Common Subsequence

Problems:
1. Largest Common substring
2. Print LCS
3. Shortest Common Supersequence
4. Print SCS
5. Min number of insertion and Deletions a -> b
6. Largest Repeating Subsequence
7. Length of largest subsequence of 'a' string, which
is a substring in 'b' string
8. Subsequnce Pattern Matching
9. Count how many times 'a' string appear as
subsequence in b.
10. Largest Palindromic subsequence
11. Largest Palindromic substring
12. Count of palindromic substring
13. Min number of deletions in a string to make it 
a palindrome
14. Min number of insertions in a string to make it
a palindrome

This is the next Pattern 
(LCS -> Longest Common Subsequence)

Flow: 
1. Recursive 
2. Bommon up and memoization
3. Top down code
The what will be the variations

Palindrome questions are a subset of LCS.

We will also learn to identify how a given problem
is a subset of LCS.
