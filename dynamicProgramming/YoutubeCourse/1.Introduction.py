DP: Advanced Recursion

How to identify DP?
Parent problem is recursion
DP = Optimal solution

How to identify recursion/dp?
1 -> Choice {whether to include a guy or not}
If only one call, there can never be overlapping.
In a recursive problem, if we have to call multiple functions,
we will have to use DP. We should consider applying dp
2 -> Optimal problems : (max, min, largest, etc...)

Parent of DP is recursion.

First write the recursive solution, always!!
Then memoize the recursive solution.
Then if possible, use the top down approach for this problem.

We can solve recursive in two ways:
either 1 -> Memoization
or Top-down

1) 0-1 knapsack (6 variations)
2) Unbounded knapsack (5)
3) Fibonacci (7)
4) LCS (logest common subsequence) (15)
5) LIS (10) (longest increasing subsequence) 
6) Kadane's Algorithm (6)
7) Matrix Chain multiplication (7) IMP
8) DP on Trees (4)
9) DP on grid (14) Give a grid, and do something
10) Others (5)

Do one think, then we will be able to solve problems pretty easily

Do around 10 problems, we will be able to do almost 80 problems.
The following above are parents questions.

DP has patterns (the above problems)
