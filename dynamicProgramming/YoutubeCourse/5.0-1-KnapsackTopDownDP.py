If you write topdown, we get some extra marks!

Complexity of Memoize and Tabulation is same.
Sometimes, any of them is better.

We can use memoization safely!

From the Constraint, we create the table array with max dimensions from the chaning inputs to function..

This will pass all the test cases even with memoization.

We need to learn Top down approach as well.
