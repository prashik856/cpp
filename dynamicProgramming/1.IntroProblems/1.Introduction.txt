Example problems:
Calculate 40th fibonacci sequence
Count the number of different ways to move through a 6x9 grid.
Given a set of coins, how can we make 27 cents in the least number of coins
Given a set of substrings, what the possible ways to construct the string 'potentpot'

Visualization is very imp:

Dynamic Programming will be covering these:
Memoization
Tabulation


1. Solving fibonacci problem as a first example:
> Write a function fib(n) that takes in number as an argument. The function should return the n-th number of Fibonacci sequence.


1st and 2nd number is 1.
Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)



canSum -> Decision Problem
howSum -> Combinatoric Problem
bestSum -> Potimization Problem
