# Stack

Usually for a given question, we will usually have a parent question.
And each of this parent question can have many variations.

We just need to understand how the parent question works, and after that we need
to understand how the question is related to the parent question.

How to identify if stack can be used in this question.

## Questions
1. Nearest Greater to left
2. Nearest Greater to right
3. Nearest Smaller to left
4. Nearest Smaller to right
5. Stock span problem
6. Maximum area of histogram
7. Max area of rectangle in binary matrix
8. Rain water trapping
9. Implementing a min stack [can be done using extra space or can be done without extra space.]
10. Implementing stack using heap
11. the celebrity problem
12. Longest valid parenthesis
13. Iterative Tower of Hanoi

## Identification
1. Most of the stack question has an array.
2. Whenever we have O(n^2) solution, and our second loop (j loop) is dependent on i,
then we have a very good chance that we can solve this question with stack.
